### Project Title: 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

This project contains the following mandatory tasks:

* 0-square.py: an empty class Square that defines a square:

* 1-square.py: Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)
<pre>
Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with size (no type/value verification)
You are not allowed to import any module
</pre>

* 2-square.py: a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)
<pre>
Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
You are not allowed to import any module
</pre>

* 3-square.py: Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py)
<pre>
Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
You are not allowed to import any module
</pre>

* 4-square.py: a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)

* 5-square.py: a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)

* 6-square.py: a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)
