### project Title: 0x04-python-more_data_structures

###### This project contains the following mandatory task:

* 0-square_matrix_simple.py: a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
	- Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
	- matrix is a 2 dimensional array
	- Returns a new matrix:
		* Same size as matrix
		* Each value should be the square of the value of the input
	- Initial matrix should not be modified
	- You are not allowed to import any module
	- You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.

* 1-search_replace.py: a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
	- Prototype: def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):
	- my_list is the initial list
	- search is the element to replace in the list
	- replace is the new element
	- You are not allowed to import any module

* 2-uniq_add.py: a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
	- Prototype: def uniq_add(my_list=[]):
	- You are not allowed to import any module

* 3-common_elements.py: a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
	- Prototype: def common_elements(set_1, set_2):
	- You are not allowed to import any module

* 4-only_diff_elements.py: a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
	- Prototype: def only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2):
	- You are not allowed to import any module

* 5-number_keys.py: a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
	- Prototype: def number_keys(a_dictionary):
	- You are not allowed to import any module

* 6-print_sorted_dictionary.py: a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
	- Prototype: def print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary):
	- You can assume that all keys are strings
	- Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order
	- Only sort keys of the first level (don't sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary)
	- Dictionary values can have any type
	- You are not allowed to import any module

* 7-update_dictionary.py

* 8-simple_delete.py

* 9-multiply_by_2.py

* 10-best_score.py

* 11-multiply_list_map.py

* 12-roman_to_int.py

###### This project contains the following advance project:

* 100-weight_average.py: a function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple (<score>, <weight>)
	- Prototype: def weight_average(my_list=[]):
	- Returns 0 if the list is empty
	- You are not allowed to import any module

* 101-square_matrix_map.py: a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map
	- Prototype: def square_matrix_map(matrix=[]):
	- matrix is a 2 dimensional array
	- Returns a new matrix:
		* Same size as matrix
		* Each value should be the square of the value of the input
	- Initial matrix should not be modified
	- You are not allowed to import any module
	- You have to use map
	- You are not allowed to use for or while
	- Your file should be max 3 lines

* 102-complex_delete.py: a function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.
	- Prototype: def complex_delete(a_dictionary, value):
	- If the value doesn’t exist, the dictionary won’t change
	- All keys having the searched value have to be deleted
	- You are not allowed to import any module

* 103-python.c: Create two C functions that print some basic info about Python lists and Python bytes objects.
